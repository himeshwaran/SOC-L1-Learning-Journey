APR PROTOCAL  (Layer2 DATA LINK )

Purpose:
	l. ARP is used to find the MAC address of a device to send the data in the LAN Network .
	
Work:
	l . When it send the data it first check its ARP cache to find the mac add for the ip address . Its not found it boardcast the request and get the response from the respective device and update its ARP cache

Vulnerability:
	l. ARP is vulnerable to attacks like ARP Spoofing  where attackers can manipulate the ARP cache to intercept or redirect

 How ARP Works (Step-by-Step)
	1. Host A wants to send to IP 192.168.1.5
	2. It checks ARP table
	3. If MAC not found → sends ARP Request (broadcast)
	4. Host B (target) replies with MAC → ARP Reply
	5. Host A stores this mapping in cache
