✅ Day 2 of My Cybersecurity Learning Challenge – ICMP Protocol 🔍
Today I dove into ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) — a core part of the IP suite that plays a crucial role in network diagnostics and error reporting.

Here’s what I learned and practiced:

📌 What is ICMP?

ICMP works at Layer 3 (Network Layer) and is used for:

Error reporting (e.g., "Destination Unreachable", "TTL Expired")

Host availability checks (ping)

Network diagnostics (traceroute)

🧠 Key Concepts I Explored
✅ ICMP is like the messenger for IP — it reports problems, but doesn’t carry actual data
📡 Common message types:

Echo Request (Type 8) & Echo Reply (Type 0)

Destination Unreachable (Type 3)

Time Exceeded (Type 11)
🧪 Tools like Wireshark can filter these using:

icmp.type == 8  # Echo request  
icmp.type == 0  # Echo reply  
icmp.type == 3  # Destination unreachable  
icmp.type == 11 # TTL expired

🎯 SOC Analyst Angle – Why This Matters

ICMP can be abused for scanning, tunneling, or covert communication

TTL Analysis can help identify OS fingerprinting and detect spoofing

e.g., TTL = 60 in a Windows-only network? Suspicious 👀

Nmap defaults to TTL = 64, but attackers can change this with --ttl flag

🧩 Pro Tip I Learned:
ICMP doesn’t encrypt anything — but payloads might look encrypted when attackers use it for covert exfiltration or tunneling 🔐
