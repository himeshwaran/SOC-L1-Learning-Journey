# 📡 Deep Dive into DHCP – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

## 🔍 What is DHCP?

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other 
network configuration parameters to devices on a network. It eliminates the need for manual IP configuration.

## 📶 How DHCP Works – Step-by-Step

DHCP follows a four-step process known as **DORA**:

| Step | Message        | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| 1️⃣   | DHCP Discover  | The client broadcasts a message to locate available DHCP servers. |
| 2️⃣   | DHCP Offer     | One or more DHCP servers respond with an offer containing an IP address and configuration. |
| 3️⃣   | DHCP Request   | The client requests the IP address offered by one of the servers. |
| 4️⃣   | DHCP ACK       | The server acknowledges and assigns the IP to the client. |

## 🧪 Technical Packet Flow


Client IP: 0.0.0.0 → Broadcast → DHCP Discover
DHCP Server → DHCP Offer (IP, lease time, subnet, gateway, DNS)
Client → DHCP Request (wants offered IP)
DHCP Server → DHCP ACK (IP assigned)
